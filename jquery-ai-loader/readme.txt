add jquery lazy loading to images

== Description ==

Delays the loading of images in long web pages by not loading immediatly 
the images that are outside of the viewport (visible part of the web page). 

== Installation ==

Unzip archive to wp-content/plugins directory, and activate it in Plugins page in wp-admin

or you can cd into your wordpress_root/wp-contents/plugins and do:

git clone git://github.com/borisschapira/Ai-Loader--jQuery-Lazy-Load-.git

== TODO ==

There are some things to improve in the plugin :
- an administration panel for defining the css class that the lazy load script affects
- a bugfix for jQuery/Prototype coexistence
